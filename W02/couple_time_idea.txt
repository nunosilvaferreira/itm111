Final Project Idea: "Couple Time" App

Description:
A web application designed to help couples spend meaningful time together through curated activities, conversation prompts, and shared goals.

APIs:
1. BoredAPI (https://www.boredapi.com/) - Fetches random activities for two people.
2. Quotable (https://api.quotable.io) - Provides relationship-themed quotes.
3. Optional: Open Trivia DB (https://opentdb.com/) for fun quizzes.

Features:
- Activity generator with filters (time, mood).
- Relationship quiz to spark conversations.
- Shared journal (localStorage).
- Weekly challenges with email reminders (EmailJS).

Why this fits WDD 330:
- Uses 2+ free APIs (no OpenWeatherMap).
- Focused frontend project (HTML/CSS/JS).
- Demonstrates API integration, DOM manipulation, and responsive design.
